    <h2>Rice</h2>
    <p>Rice is the principal food of our people and grown in this country from time
        immemorial. It contributes for about 92% of the total food grains produced in the
        country. Seventy-five percent of required calories and 55% of protein are met from
        rice in the average daily diet of the people. Bangladesh is the fourth largest rice
        producer in the world. It covers about 77% of agricultural land and engages about
        70% of population in rice production activities. Nearly 50% of our employments are
        generated in rice sector. The contribution of rice to GDP is 18%. At present, rice
        occupies 11.42 million hectares of land and produces about 33.6 million metric ton
        (BBS, 2011). Nobanno (new rice harvest) is one of the joyous festivals, which is
        largely observed in rural areas. Different kinds of delicious foods are made from rice
        in different occasions. Products of the rice plant are used for different purposes, such
        as fuel, thatching, industrial starch, animal feed and artwork. It also ensures political
        stability and food security for the people.</p>

    <p>Rice is grown year-round in Bangladesh as pre-monsoon crop, direct seeded and
        transplanted Aus rice from March to June (kharif-1), wet season transplanted aman
        rice (kharif-11), from June to November and dry season irrigated Boro (rabi) rice
