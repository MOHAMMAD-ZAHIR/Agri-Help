        <h2>Production Technology</h2>
        <h3>Land and soil</h3>
        <p>Wheat may be grown in high land and medium high land, and also in medium low
            land where water receding takes place before November. Land and soil should be
            well drained. Generally loam, sandy loam and clay loam soils are suitable for wheat
            cultivation. For rainfed wheat cultivation or cultivation with residual moisture clay
            soil is preferable. All the varieties could be grown in low salinity ( < &nbsp; 6 dS/m during seedling
                stage). However, variety BARI Gom 25 can tolerate salinity of 8-10 dS/m and suitable for growing in
                southern Bangladesh. The varieties BARI Gom 24 (Prodip), BARI Gom25 and BARI Gom 26 are to some extent
                tolerant to sterility and suitable for Boron deficient soils.</p> <h3>Seed rate</h3>
                <p>Considering seed germination of 80% or more, 120 kg seed per hectare is
                    recommended. However, for the large seeded variety (BARI Gom 24), 15-20 kg more
                    seed per hectare is recommended to maintain standard plant population.</p>

                <h3>Seed treatment </h3>
                <p>Seed treatment with Provax-200 @ 3g per kg seed before sowing is recommended. It
                    increases plant population by 20-25% and grain yield by about 10-12%.</p>

                <h3>Time of sowing</h3>
                <p>The optimum sowing time for wheat is 15-30 November. Since the winter is prolonged to some extent in
                    the northern region, seeds could be sown up to first week
                    of December for optimum yield. If seeds are sown beyond this time, yield may be
                    decreased by 1.3% for each day delay. However, varieties like BARI Gom 23, BARI
                    Gom 24, BARI Gom 25, BARI Gom 26, and BARI Gom 28 possess good level of
                    heat tolerance and can be sown up to mid December with moderate yield.
                </p>
                <h3>Land preparation</h3>
                <p>Land should be prepared by country
                    plough, Power Tiller (2-Wheel Tractor)
                    or 4-Wheel Tractor if the land is at
                    optimum“Zoe” (appropriate moisture
                    level) condition. Land may be prepared
                    by Power tiller operated seeder (PTOS)
                    along with seeding.</p>
                <p>PTOS performs 3 functions i.e.
                    ploughing, seeding in rows and
                    laddering, simultaneously. Excess
                    ploughing may reduce soil moisture,
                    which may affect germination of seeds.
                    If there is shortage of moisture in the
                    soil, irrigation should be given before
                    ploughing. Further, if there is shortage
                    of moisture in the soil and also there is not enough time to allow soil to reach “Zoe”
                    (appropriate moisture level) condition after the pre-sowing irrigation, a light
                    irrigation should be applied after sowing seeds for proper germination. Wheat can
                    also be planted using a bed planter in raised bed system.</p>

                <h3>Sowing method</h3>
                <p>Seed could be sown 20 cm apart in solid line for better germination and intercultural
                    practices.</p>

                <h3>Fertilizer application</h3>
                <p>Fertilizers like Urea, TSP, MP, Gypsum and Boric
                    acid is recommended @ 220, 150, 100, 100, 6-7 kg
                    per hectare, respectively. Two-third (2/3) of urea
                    and all other fertilizers should be applied at the final
                    land preparation as basal and the rest 1/3 urea
                    would be top dressed at 1st irrigation (17-20 days
                    after sowing). In case of acid soil (pH 4.5-5.5), Lime (Dolomite) is recommended to apply @ 1.0
                    ton/ha once in 3 years cycle. Lime
                    should be mixed with soil by ploughing 1-2 weeks before seeding.</p>

                <h3>Irrigation</h3>
                <p>Two or three irrigations are essential depending on the
                    soil moisture condition. Generally, first irrigation is
                    applied at 3-leaves stage i.e., 17-21 DAS at Crown
                    Root Initiation stage. If the soil is too dry, irrigation
                    should be given as early as at 15 DAS. First irrigation
                    should be very light and excess water should be
                    drained out immediately. If there is enough moisture
                    in the soil, irrigation
                    should be delayed for
                    some days. Second
                    and third irrigations
                    should be applied at
                    maximum tillering
                    stage (50-55 DAS)
                    and early stage of
                    grain filling (70-80 DAS), respectively. An additional irrigation before or after sowing
                    may be essential if there is not enough soil moisture for seed germination. Before
                    starting irrigation, weather condition should be observed. If there is a possibility of
                    rain, irrigation should be delayed. Third irrigation should also be light to avoid lodging.</p>
