        <h2>Harvesting and Seed Preservation</h2>
        <p>When plants become mature, the leaves of the lower parts of plants become yellow.
            Surface of pods become rough and hard, veins become prominent, inner surface of
            pods shell becomes blackish in colour. Cover of kernels become brown in colour.
            These are the ideal condition when the crop is ready for harvest.</p>
        <p>Pods should be dried for 8 hours after harvesting. Moisture content of pods should be
            8-9%. Seeds should be cooled and then stored after sun drying. For storing
            groundnut, different types of containers may be used. If seeds are stored in air tight
            condition whether polythene bags and synthetic bags, the quality of seeds and
            viability of seeds are restored for more than one year but during rainy season, seeds
            should be checked and dried and kept in the same container.
