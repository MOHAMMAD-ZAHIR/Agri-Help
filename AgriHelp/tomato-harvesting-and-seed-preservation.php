        <h2>Harvesting and Seed Preservation</h2>
        <p><strong>Seed harvesting:</strong> Seed fruits are allowed to ripen to maturity on the plant. Only
            complete coloured and matured seed fruits are harvested. The seed yield of tomato is
            145 kg/ha.</p>
        <p><strong>Seed preservation:</strong> Slice the selected fruits and separate the seeds then keep it 200-
            210C temperature and fermented for 24-36 hours. Wash the seeds properly after
            fermentation. After washing, dry the seeds properly and reduce moisture below 8%.
            Seeds should be preserved in air tight containers with dry and cool temperature.
        </p>
        <h3>Production Technology (summer tomato)</h3>
        <h4>Climate, land and Soil</h4>
        <p>The most important limiting factor of summer tomato cultivation during rainy-summer season (March-October) is
            the high rain and high temperature when the temperature ranges from 25-350C even as high as 400C in
            Bangladesh. On an average
            200 mm of rainfall per annum falls on 80% of the land during this period. The rainy-summer season is the
            most difficult season for cultivation, as it corresponds to a high
            temperature period and crops are often damaged by heavy rain, high temperature and
            pest. High to medium land is required for tomato cultivation. Tomato may be grown
            on a wide range of soil from sandy to clay. The optimum soil PH of summer tomato
            should be 6.5-7.0.
        </p>
        <h3>Tunnel preparation</h3>
        <h4>Preparation of raised beds and polyethylene tunnel</h4>
        <p>The raised bed planting is beneficial and commonly
            adopted in low land tropics and high rainfall areas or
            for rainy season cropping. Generally, wider beds in
            loamy and heavy soils while narrower beds in
            lighter soils are recommended.</p>
        <p>During summer particularly in rainy season
            transparent poly tunnel is to be built on the raised
            beds to protect the plants. The raised beds height is
            to be maintained at 30 cm and width of two beds
            should be 2.30 cm (including 30 cm wide drainage
            channel in the middle point) along with a convenient
            length for each are to be arranged for making one
            tunnel. In this case tunnel height should be 120 cm
            on both sides and 180 cm in the middle. Between
            two tunnels there must be about 75 cm wide
            drainage channel to facilitate irrigation or drainage
            of water and for other operations.</p>
