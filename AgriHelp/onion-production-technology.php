        <h2>Production Technology</h2>
        <h3>Land and soil</h3>
        <p>Onion may be grown on various soils. But it grows well in friable and well-drained
            sandy-loam to clay-loam soil along with optimum PH range between 5.8 and 6.5. The
            crop is sensitive to high acidity, alkalinity and salinity. Onions do not thrive well in
            the soil below PH 5.8 because of trace element deficiencies and sometimes
            aluminum/manganese toxicity. The water-holding capacity of the soil should be high
            as onion is a shallow rooted crop. Good drainage is essential. Waterlogging may
            cause failure of the crop. Sandy soil needs more and frequent irrigations but favour
            early maturity, whereas heavy soil gives rise to misshapen bulbs. </p>
        <h3>Seed rate</h3>
        <p>Seed rate of onion depends on its quality, planting system, planting time, spacing etc.
            4-5 kg seeds for transplanting system whereas 7-8 kg true seeds and 1200-1500 kg
            onion sets are required for cultivation of one hectare land in direct seeding and set
            planting method, respectively.</p>
        <h3>Seed treatment</h3>
        <p>Seed should be treated with Dithane M-45 2 g/kg of seeds to avoid damage from
            diseases before sowing and protect seedlings from damping off (<em>Pythium spp</em>).</p>
        <h3>Time of sowing</h3>
        <p>In transplanting and direct seeding method, the best time for sowing rabi (winter)
            crop is late October to November. In case of early and late kharif (summer) onion, it
            is sown in February to March and July to August, respectively. In set planting
            method, the optimum time is September to October. In case of seed production, late
            October to November is the optimum time to plant seed bulb.</p>
        <h3>Sowing method</h3>
        <p>Direct seeding: In this method, seed rate is high. Intercultural operation is difficult for
            improper plant population. The plants can not use natural resources properly. The bulb
            yield is poor. Shelf life of the bulbs is comparatively very poor but labour cost is low.</p>
        <p>Onion sets planting: The bulbs produced in this method are entirely fresh (green
            onion) and these bulbs are immediately consumed. Premature bolting occurs in this
            crop planting. Seed rate of the sets are high. </p>
        <p>Seedlings transplanting: This is conventional seedling transplanting method, widely
            practiced by farmers. This method shows better results for longer shelf life of onion
            bulbs although the labour involvement and cost is high. The seedlings are usually
            transplanted on flat beds at a spacing of 15 cm from line to line and 8-10 cm from
            plant to plant. </p>
        <h3>Seedbed preparation</h3>
        <p>Onion seeds are sown in nursery beds to raise seedlings. The raised beds of 3 m long x
            1 m wide and 20-30 cm high are preferred. The length of seed bed may also be formed
            in a convenient length depending upon type of soil, level of land, irrigation method
            etc. Raised bed is necessary to avoid problem of waterlogging in heavy soil. About 50
            cm distance should be provided between 2 beds for easy operation of watering,
            weeding, spraying of pesticides etc. The surface of the beds should be smooth and
            well-levelled. Insecticide like Furadan should be incorporated in the seed bed to kill
            the soil insect-pests. The bed may be covered with polythene for solarization.</p>
        <h3>Land preparation</h3>
        <p>Prior to planting sets or direct seeding or transplanting seedlings, land is to be
            ploughed sufficiently to eliminate debris and soil clods. The onion land should be
            ploughed to a fine tilth by 4-5 times with a sufficient interval between two ploughings.
            The land may be ploughed by tractor or power tiller or country plough. But for well
            pulverization of the field, ploughing by tractor-driven implements is suitable. After
            ploughing, laddering is done for proper leveling. The field is then divided into beds of
            1 m wide along with convenient length and channels of 50 cm wide.
        </p>
        <h3>Fertilizer dose and application methods</h3>
        <p>The requirement of nutrients depends on soil type, topography, AEZs, varieties, soil
            nutrient status etc. Onion responds very well to organic manures. About 5-10 tons of
            cowdung per hectare is adequate. Onion requires higher levels of fertilizers for
            maximum yields than most other vegetable crops. Green manuring with Dhaincha
            (<em>Sesbania aculeata</em>) and Sunnhemp (<em>Crotalaria juncea</em>) may be done to enrich soil
            health. Fertilizer dose and application methods are furnished below:</p>

        <h3>For seed production</h3>
        <p>Manures and fertilizers are to be applied in land with well decomposed cowdung: 10
            tons, urea: 260, TSP: 300MP: 150, Gypsum:100 and Boric acid:10 kg/ha,
            respectively. The entire quantities of well-decomposed cowdung are to be applied just
            after opening of the land. The total amounts of phosphorus, Gypsum, Boric acid and
            two-third of Potassium should be added during final land preparation. The entire urea
            is to be incorporated in three equal splits 20, 40 and 60 days after seed bulb planting.
            The rest amount of Potassium should be applied 60 days after seed bulb planting.</p>
        <h3>Irrigation</h3>
        <p>Onion is a shallow rooted crop. Its root system is normally restricted to top 3 cm and
            roots penetrate seldom deeper (15 cm). The water requirement in onion crops depend
            upon crop growth, soil type, planting season etc. The water requirement at initial
            growth stage is less. At bulb formation, irrigation is necessary and moisture stress at
            this stage may lower the yield. The field should not be kept dry for long spell which
            otherwise results in splitting and allow to crop early maturity resulting lower yield.
            Frequent and light irrigation at weekly intervals have shown good results in bulb
            development, increase in yield and quality of the produces. Depending upon rain and
            soil type, 5-6 irrigations are enough. As the onion begins to mature and the tops begin
            to fall down, irrigation has to be terminated to stop root growth and allow the outer
            scale of the bulb to become dry and firm. Thus, irrigation should be stopped at least
            15-20 days before harvesting for improving the keeping quality of bulbs. </p>
