    <h2>Maize</h2>
    <p>Maize is one of the most important cereal crops in the country and the leading crop of
        the world after rice and wheat. It has high productivity due to its large leaf area and
        being a C4 plant has one of the highest photosynthetic rates of all food crops. Maize
        has the highest potential for carbohydrate production per unit area per day. It can be
        grown throughout the year because of its photo-insensitiveness. The maize seed crop
        contains 11% protein and its nutrient value is higher in comparison to rice and wheat.
        In Bangladesh, it occupies 1.68 lac hectares land and produces10.38 lac metric tons
        with an average yield of 6.27t/ha (BBS, 2011). It can be grown for various uses such
        as fodder, sweet corn, baby corn, boiled, roasted cobs, pop corn, as field corn for feed
        and human consumption and various industrial processed products. Maize can be
        intercropped profitability with mungbean, soybean, groundnut, vegetables and
        potatoes etc. Maize has become very popular in the country because of its diversified
        uses, increasing demand from poultry industry, higher nutritive value, higher per
        hectare yield and net benefit than other cereals. The area and production of maize is
        increasing rapidly in the country.</p>
