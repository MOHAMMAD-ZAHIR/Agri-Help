    <h2>Harvesting and Seed Preservation</h2>
    <div>
        <p>There are two ways to harvest the crop. One is, when almost all the pods turned
            brown, the plants may be pulled out and another one is to cut at the ground level with
            a sickle, then drying in the field or on the threshing floor. When the plants and pods
            dry then brittle with a stick. Often, cattle or power thresher are allowed to trample on
            the plants to thresh the pods. Seeds should be cleaned by winnowing, which is
            generally done by tossing the produce in the air with forks on a windy day.</p>
        <h3>Seed preservation</h3>
        <p>Lentil should be properly stored because seed is vulnerable to heavy insect damage.
            The seeds should be cleaned, dried thoroughly in sun and moisture content should be
            lowered down to 8-9 %. Then seeds should be cooled and kept either in sealed
            polythene bags along with naphthalene balls covered by jute bags, tin containers or
            air tight earthen pots in store rooms. Finally, seed should be stored in dry and above
            ground place.</p>
