    <h2>Harvesting and Seed Preservation</h2>
    <p>In onion, neckfall is the indication of maturity for bulb. Time of harvest depends on
        several factors such as planting season, cultivar, market price, conditions of the crop
        etc. The duration of the crop is usually 5.5 and 3.5 months for rabi and kharif season,
        respectively. If onions are grown by direct seeding method, the crop is ready for
        about 20-25 days earlier than the transplanted ones. When the bulbs mature, the green
        tops become weaken and fall down that is called neckfall. When neckfall begins,
        irrigarion is to be stopped. In general, when more than 50% neckfall is found, the
        bulbs are harvested along with leaves by hand-pulling. The harvested plants with
        bulbs are allowed to cure for about 7 days. After complete curing, the roots and tops
        are clipped. The leaves are cut leaving about 2.25 cm tops above the bulbs. Curing is
        the drying of neck, root and outer scale tissue to remove excess moisture from them.
        It is essential to prevent disease infection, shrinkage and development of bad colour
        in bulb</p>
    <h3>Bulb storage</h3>
    <p>The harvested bulbs are usually stored both for human consumption throughout the
        year and for growing seeds in the next year. Storage techniques and storage
        conditions have great impact on the shelf life of onion. Proper storage is crucial for
        retaining bulb quality. Factors influencing storage bulbs are variety, growing season,
        harvesting stage, curing, fertilizer and irrigation application, storage techniques,
        storage conditions, temperature and humidity etc. Early harvesting results in
        sprouting of bulbs while late harvesting results in formation of secondary roots
        during storage. Thick-neck bulbs resulting from premature harvesting also do not
        store well. The bulbs should be graded according to size and quality. Cool, dry and
        well ventilated store room will keep onion bulbs in good conditions for many
        months. On average, the storage loss of onion bulb may be 45-60% due to
        respiration weight loss, rotting of bulb and sprouting. This storage loss can be
        minimized by selection of suitable varieties with long shelf life, efficient irrigation
        management, balanced fertilization, optimum time of planting, proper harvesting
        time and improved storage. In cold storage, onion can be stored nearly for 10-12
        months with temperature 0-5ÂºC and relative humidity 60%. The rabi (winter) onion
        store well than the kharif ones.
