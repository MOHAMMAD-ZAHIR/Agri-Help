        <h1>Production Technology</h1>
        <h3>Land and soil</h3>
        <p>Medium high land to lowland is suitable for rice cultivation depending on growing
            season. Any land type can be brought under rice cultivation; but its cultivation may
            not be economical. Clay and loamy, slightly acidic to slightly alkaline soils are
            suitable for rice cultivation. </p>

        <h3>Seed rate</h3>
        <p>Seed rate varies depending on crop establishment methods. For example, direct-seeded rice (DSR) requires more
            seed rate than transplanted ones. Direct seeded
            upland rice: 50-60 kg/ha; Transplanted rice: 8-10 kg/ha for one seedling/hill and 16-
            20 kg/ha for 2-3 seedlings/hill would be required. </p>

        <h3>Seed treatment and soaking</h3>
        <p>Good quality seed is the prime requirement for a good harvest. Use of properly filled,
            healthy seeds would ensure 5-20% higher yields than poor quality seeds. Good seeds
            can be sorted out easily. Dissolve 375g urea in 10 litres of water and put 10 kg seed
            into the container and stir seeds by hand. Fully filled seeds will be deposited at the
            bottom of the container. Discard unfilled floated seeds from the top. Remove good seeds from the container;
            wash it 3-4 times with clean water. If the sorted seeds are
            spotless, seed treatment is not essential. However, seed may be treated in 52-550C hot
            water for 15 minute. Seed may also be treated with Carbendazim fungicide @ 2-3 g/l
            of water for 12 hours. One kilogram seeds should be used for each litre of water.
            After 12 hours of seed treatment, it should be washed with clean water.
        </p>

        <h3>Seed soaking:</h3>
        <p>Seed soaking time is 12-24 hours depending on water temperature
            followed by incubation for germination. Incubation period for germination in Aus and
            Aman season is about 48 hours and for Boro season is 72 hours. </p>

        <h3>Time of sowing</h3>
        <p>Time of sowing and its subsequent management greatly influence grain yield of rice
            in different growing seasons. Seeds can be sown directly in the main field for direct-seeded rice (DSR); but
            transplanted culture requires sowing seeds in seedbed. A
            generalized sowing time is shown below:</p>

    </div>
    <div class="container pt-2 mb-3" style="text-align: justify;">
        <h3>Seedbed preparation</h3>
        <p>Clay and loamy fertile soils are essential for
            seedling raising. However, if fertile soil is not
            available then 2 kg organic fertilizer, 4g triple
            super phosphate, 7 gm muriate of potash per
            square meter needs to be added. After 10 days
            of seeding, 7g urea and 10 gm gypsum may
            require for healthy seedling raising. Land
            should be plowed and cross plowed 3-4 times
            followed by laddering and keep the soil
            submerged by 5-6 cm water for 7-10 days.
            Finally bed soil is made soft and muddy by
            plowing and laddering. One meter wide bed is
            prepared lengthwise of the land. There should be 25-30 cm space in between two beds from which soil is
            removed at 5-7 cm depth
            and spread over the bed. Similar way soil of border areas is removed and spread over
            the bed. Finally, bed soil is leveled by a flat wooden plank and kept undisturbed for
            about 3-4 hours for seeding pre-germinated seeds. Fifty to 60 gm seed/m2 is used in
            the seed bed. The canal formed in between two beds can be used for irrigation and
            drainage purposes.</p>

        <h3>Land preparation and transplanting</h3>
        <p>Land for direct-seeded upland rice is generally prepared either in dry or optimum soil
            moisture conditions. Three to four plowing followed by laddering or harrowing may
            require for a good tilth depending on soil types. Land for transplanted culture is
            prepared in wet conditions to make the soil soft and muddy. Three to four plowing
            and cross plowing followed by laddering may require for transplanting. However, rice
            can also be transplanted in zero tillage conditions, provided that the soil is soft and
            there are no weeds or stubbles. At final plowing and laddering, land should be
            properly leveled for keeping similar water depth throughout the field.</p>

        <h3>Transplanting:</h3>
        <p>Seedlings are uprooted carefully before transplanting. In general, 20-
            25 day-old seedlings are transplanted in Aus season, 25-35 day-old in Aman season
            and 35-45 day-old in Boro season. One vigorous healthy seedling can be used in a
            hill. However, 2-3 seedlings/hill may be utilized at 2-3 cm depth. Transplanting
            should be done in rows to facilitate intercultural operations. Row to row distance
            should be 20-25 cm and plant to plant, 15-20 cm. If seedlings are dead or hills are
            missing, re-transplanting should be done within 7-10 days.</p>

        <h3>Fertilizer application</h3>
        <p>Balanced use of fertilizers is essential for satisfactory grain yield. Fertilizer rate
            depends on weather, indigenous soil fertility, variety, growth duration and yield
            potential etc. Depending on growth duration, yield and season variable amounts are
            needed for satisfactory grain yield (Table 1).

    <div class="container pt-2 mb-5" style="text-align: justify;">
        <h3>Some additional points on fertilizer application time and methods:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Organic fertilizers should be added at first plowing during wet season.</li>
            <li>In light textured soils, potash fertilizer should be added in two splits- two third at
                final land preparation and 1/3rd at 5-7 days before panicle initiation (PI).</li>
            <li>Carry over effect of zinc sulfate may be observed in succeeding two crops.</li>
            <li>Urea fertilizer needs to be added in every cropping season. It should be applied in
                four equal splits for light textured soils. It is better to apply urea in 2-5 cm water
                followed by incorporation mechanically.</li>
            <li>Zinc and sulfur fertilizers are to be added during final land preparation for Zn and
                S deficient soils. However, they can be utilized after transplanting for correcting
                deficiency symptoms in rice.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Use of urea super granules</h3>
        <p>Urea super granule (USG) is made
            from urea, which looks like tablet.
            Use of USG improves urea use-efficiency by 20-25%. Rice should be
            transplanted in rows at 20 cm apart
            for using USG in between four hills.
            USG is placed at 7-10 cm deep into
            soil at 15-20 and 7-10 DAT during Boro and Aus and Aman seasons, respectively. In
            general, one grainule of 1.8 gm is used in Aus and Aman seasons; on the other hand,
            one grainule of 2.7 gm is used in Boro season. So, it supply 110 kg urea/ha in Aus and
            Aman seasons and 165 Kg urea/ha in Boro season. However, USG rate adjustment
            may be required depending on soil fertility and yield potential of rice variety.</p>

        <h3>Irrigation</h3>
        <p>Rice can be grown without continuous standing
            water. Generally, 2-4 cm standing water can be kept
            up to 10-12 DAT and then reduced amount to
            facilitate tillering and reduction of irrigation cost.
            Since rice is mainly grown as irrigated crop during
            Boro season, loss of irrigation water can be
            minimized by using plastic and PVC pipes. Alternate
            wetting and drying (AWD) technique can be employed to save irrigation water. In this
            system 25 cm long and 7-10 cm dia PVC pipe is used in which 15 cm is perforated.
            This perforated 15 cm is placed into soil vertically followed by removal of inside soil.
            When water is seen at the bottom of the pipe, the land is irrigated at 5-7 cm water
            depth. This technique is followed after crop establishment and continues upto
            vegetative stage. Standing water should be maintained at PI to milking stage.</p>
