                    Leaves are broad, droopy and dark green in colour. It
                    is an early maturing variety. Grains per spike: 35-
                    40. Grains are white-amber and larger in size. 1000-
                    grain weight: 47-52g. The variety is tolerant to high
                    temperature and gives 10-20% higher yield under
                    late seeding. Flour is suitable for chapati making.
                    The variety is tolerant to leaf blight and resistant to
                    leaf rust diseases and moderately tolerant to terminal
                    heat stress. Grain yield: 4.3-5.0 t/ha. Duration:

                    Grains per spike: 45-50. The flour is most suitable
                    for bread making due to its strong gluten. It can be
                    grown successfully throughout the country except in
                    saline areas more than 6 mmhos. Grain yield: 4.3-

                <td>The variety is semi-dwarf, early maturing and high
                    yielding. Plant height: 95-100 cm. Leaves are deep
                    green and broad. It takes 57-62 days to heading.
                    Grains per spike: 45-55. Grains are amber in colour
                    and bright. 1000-grain weight: 54-58g. It shows
                    moderate level of tolerance to terminal heat stress
                    giving 6-10% higher yield under late seeding. The
                    variety is highly tolerant to bipolaris leaf blight and
                    resistant to leaf rust diseases. It can be grown under
                    both optimum and late seeding conditions. The
                    variety is moderately tolerant to salinity. Therefore,
                    it can be grown in southern region having salinity
                    level below 10 dS/m. Grain yield: 3.6-4.6 t/ha.

                    resistant to leaf rust diseases with moderate level of
                    resistance to stem rust race (Ug99). The variety is
                    suitable for growing both in optimum and late
                    seeding condition. It can also be grown successfully
                    throughout the country except in areas with salinity
                    level less than 6 dS/m. Grain yield: 3.5-4.5 t/ha.

                    upto December 15-20. Grains per spike: 45-50. The
                    variety is resistant to stem rust race (Ug99) and leaf
                    rust and moderately resistant to bipolaris leaf blight.

                <td>This is a high yielding, short stature and early
                    maturing variety. Plant height: 95-100 cm. It takes
                    60-65days for heading It is highly tolerant to
                    terminal heat stress due to its earliness and grain
                    yield 15-20% higher under late seeding. Grains per
                    spike: 45-50. Grains are white, amber in colour and
                    medium in size. 1000-grain weight: 35-40g. The
                    variety is resistant to leaf rust and moderately
                    tolerant to bipolaris leaf blight. It also shows adult
                    plant resistance (APR) to Ug99 race of stem rust.
                    Due to its earliness and heat tolerance capacity it
                    could fit well in the rice-wheat cropping system of
                    Bangladesh. It could also be grown in southern part
                    with salinity level up to 8.0 dS/m. Grain yield: 3.5-
                    5.4 t/ha. Duration: 105-110 days.</td>
