    <h2>Intercultural Operation</h2>
    <div>
        <p>One weeding at 25-30 DAS is recommended for good yield. Weeds may be
            controlled by hand weeding after first irrigation. Some herbicides viz., 2, 4-D Amine,
            Affinity or Fielder could be applied at the rate of 35ml herbicide in 10 litres of water
            for controlling broad leaf weeds and must be sprayed between 25 and 30 DAS in
            sunny days. For chemical weed control, accurate dose of herbicide and spraying need
            special attention.</p>

        <h3>Pest management</h3>
        <h4>Major diseases and control measures:</h4>
        <p>Bipolaris leaf blight and leaf rust are
            the two major diseases of wheat in
            Bangladesh. Black point disease also
            occurs in some developed years due
            to rains at maturity stage. Newly
            developed varieties of wheat are
            resistant to leaf rust and tolerant to
            leaf blight diseases.</p>

        <h4>Control measures:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Use resistant variety.</li>
            <li>Spraying of Tilt 250 EC 2 times (at heading and 15 days later) @ 0.5 ml per litre of
                water is effective to control the incidence of bipolaris leaf blight disease and also
                leaf rust in case of late sown wheat. It also controls black point disease and
                improves the quality of seed.</li>
            <li>Seed treatment with Provax-200 @ 3g per kg of seed could reduce the incidence of
                seed borne diseases like Bipolaris leaf blight, black point, etc.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Major pests: Bird and Rat</h3>
        <h4>Control measures:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Bird should be kept away for 10-12 days after sowing.</li>
            <li>Rat should be controlled using traps or poison (Zinc phosphide, Racumin, etc.) or
                by any other traditional means. </li>
        </ul>
