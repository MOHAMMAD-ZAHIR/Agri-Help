    <h2>Harvesting and Seed Preservation</h2>
    <p>Harvesting should be done when plants show distinct signs of drying, the husk cover
        is completely dry and the grains are fully mature. Grain maturity could be identified
        from the milk line of kernels or the formation of a black layer at the junction of grain
        and placenta. Premature harvesting reduces the yield and the germination ability of
        the seed. If possible, a prompt harvest of the seed crop after it reaches physiological
        maturity is recommended, as delays will unduly expose the seed to temperature,
        rainfall, diseases and insects, bird damage, and theft. It is commonly harvested with
        15 to 25% moisture content. Harvesting fully mature grain would result in maximum
        yield, improved appearance and reduced susceptibility to injury from high drying
        temperatures. In Bangladesh, harvesting is done by hand. The cobs are separated
        from the stem and the plants are cut near the ground. Soon after harvesting, the cobs
        should be dehusked and sundried for about 2-3 days. Dried cobs are shelled either by
        corn sheller or by hand. Both power and manually operated sheller could be used.
        The shelled kernels should be dried again before storing at optimum moisture level of
        12 to 13 percent.</p>
    <p>Drying is important before storage to avoid deterioration, reduction of seed borne
        insect and diseases attack and to maintain viability of seed. If maize grains are used
        for seed purpose, it may be treated with a fungicide or a combination of fungicide and
        insecticide to protect it against attack by diseases and insect pests. The treatment
        should be done before logging and storage.</p>
