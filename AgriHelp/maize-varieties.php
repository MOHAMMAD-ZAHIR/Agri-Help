        <h2>Varieties</h2>
        <p>Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute (BARI) has so far developed 8 (eight)
            high yielding variety of maize (composite) and 11 (eleven) hybrid maize through
            collection and selection. A brief discussion of these popular varieties (both in
            composite and hybrid maize) along with important features is given below::</p>
